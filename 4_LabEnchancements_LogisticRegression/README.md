# **Multilabel classification using Logistical Regression**

---



In this lab enhancement, the following are done:

1. Explanation of Multilabel classification vs Multiclass classification & Binary relevance to train a logistic regression model
2. Common problem with multilabel data - class imbalance
2. Applying logistic regression on multilabel sets
- 1 logistic regression models for each of the 3 class labels
3. Using 'MultiOutputClassifier' as an alternative to logistic regression
4. Logistic Regression, Sigmoid function and Neural Network for Multiclass classification
- Graph 3 sigmoids for 3 multilabel classes
5. Performance metrics for multiclass classification
- Precision, Recall, F1 score
- Why accuracy is not a good measure
